# Skilleroatsje
»Skilleroatsje« is a gallery mod for Minetest. This mod uses some code from the [gemalde mod by CasimirKaPazi](https://github.com/CasimirKaPazi/gemalde).
I've added some protection. You can now modify an image only with a right click if you are the owner of the image.

You can insert your own images very easily. Take an image (it must always be square, for example 16x16px or 150x150px for better resolution). The name of the image must always start with skilleroatsje, then an underscore and a consecutive number (example skilleroatsje_1.png). Only png format can be used.


# Why is the mod called »Skilleroatsje«?
The term »Skilleroatsje« comes from the language [Sater Frisian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saterland_Frisians) [(saterfriesisch)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saterfriesen). It is spoken in my old hometown and means something like painting.
